# Layout studies

In this project I am investigating *all* the different ways we can layout items on the web. I am doing this because there is a lot of research about laying things out on paper, but not so much about laying things out on the web. Not all paper layout theory translates very well to the flexible web, hence this study.

For now I study two different types: laying out a *known* amount of items and laying out an *unknown* amount. I look at relations between text items, between image items, and between combinations. Yes, this is an insane undertaking, but with a little help I think we might come a long way.
