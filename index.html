		<h2>Fixed amount of items</h2>
		<p>We often have complete control over the exact amount of items on a page, or on a section of a page. It is interesting to research how different amounts of items react to one another. It's also interesting to research if different types of content react differently in the same situations.</p>
		<section>
			<h3>Single item</h3>
			<p>There are many ways to display one single item. There are many different types of items, of course, but the way we show them can vary considerably, depending on many factors, like screen size for instance.</p>
			<section>
				<h4>Examples with text</h4>
				<p>What are the possible layouts, or combinations of layouts for one single text item? A <em>text item</em> can be any text, long or short, with no other content to share the layout with. An article, for instance.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/text/variant-1/">
							<h5>A single, flexible column</h5>
							<p>The most basic possible layout. The archetypical web layout of the ninetees. One flexible text item without a maximum width.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/text/variant-2/">
							<h5>A single, flexible column with a maximum with</h5>
							<p>A very basic layout. The fluid web layout sometimes seen in the early years of 2000. One flexible text item with a maximum width in order to keep things readable.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/text/variant-3/">
							<h5>Flexible, single or multi-column layout with max-width</h5>
							<p>On bigger screens, it uses a simple three column grid to make the first heading and the first paragraph stand out. This kind of layout is especially useful for longer articles. Other elements can span across all three columns as well, if needed. It's a rather classic layout, sometimes seen in books and magazines.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/text/variant-4/">
							<h5>Flexible, single or multi-column layout with max-width</h5>
							<p>The same as the previous example, but with an extra column for wider viewports, in which things like marginal notes can be shown.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/text/variant-5/">
							<h5>Single, flexible column with changing percentages, with a rather large max width</h5>
							<p>This is a simple looking one column layout. The margins to the left and right change a few times, at different viewport sizes. The width of the measure grows from 91% to 60% with a max-width of 44.5em. But there's more. An interesting thing about this layout is that the first paragraph is 7% wider that the body copy, and the heading is even wider: 15%</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/text/variant-6/">
							<h5>Single, flexible small column with two fixed widths</h5>
							<p>This is a rather simple single column layout. It starts out with a width of 90% on smaller screens, with a max width of 27em. It then stops for a while and collects a lot of white-space to the left and right. Once there is room enough, the width of the measure is set to 41.375em, and the font size is increased.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/text/variant-7/">
							<h5>Flexible, single or multi-column layout with some max-widths and some parts spanning multiple columns</h5>
							<p>This is a set of layouts that gets more complex as the viewport grows. At first everything is layed out over one single column, but as soon as the measure allows for an extra column, it is added to the left. This can be repeated.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

				<h4>Examples with an image</h4>
				<p>What are the possible layouts, or combinations of layouts for one single image, without any text? An <em>image</em> can be any kind of graphic, like a photo, a graph, or a dynamic canvas.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/image/variant-1/">
							<h5>An image with a fixed size</h5>
							<p>Just an image without any styling. It will be displayed as 640px wide and 480px high. If a screen is smaller, parts of it will be cut off. If the screen is wider there will be white space around it. There might be some use-cases for this pattern. I don't know many. Showing the size of the image in relation to the size of the viewport is one of them.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/image/variant-2/">
							<h5>An image of 100% width, with a max-width</h5>
							<p>This image is fluid in width and height, as long as the viewport is less than 640px wide. If the screen is smaller than 640px, the image will be 100% wide, and the height will automatically adjust, to keep the correct ratio. If the screen is wider there will be white space around it. This is a fairly common pattern, it is one of the more basic responsive image solutions.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/image/variant-3/">
							<h5>An image of 100% width, without a max-width</h5>
							<p>This image is fluid in width and height. It is always as wide as the viewport, and the height will automatically adjust, to keep the correct ratio. If the screen gets wider than the width of the image (640px) the image may look blurry. An image replacement technique could be used to fix this.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/image/variant-4/">
							<h5>An image of 100% width and 100% height, <em>without</em> a max-width or max-height.</h5>
							<p>This image is fluid in width and height. It is always as wide and high as the viewport, which means that the image will probably not be displayed in the correct ratio. If the screen gets wider than the width of the image (640px), or higher than the height (480px) the image may look blurry. It will probably look weird to most people.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/image/variant-5/">
							<h5>A fullscreen, left aligned image that doesn't deform.</h5>
							<p>This image is always fullscreen. When the viewport has a bigger aspect-ratio than the image, part of the image will be cut off from the bottom. If the viewport has a smaller aspect-ratio than the image, part of the image will be cut off from the right. So, it will always show an incomplete image unless the aspect-ratio of the viewport is exactly the same as the aspect-ratio of the image.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/01-single-item/image/variant-6/">
							<h5>A fullscreen centered image that doesn't deform.</h5>
							<p>This image is always fullscreen. When the viewport has a bigger aspect-ratio than the image, part of the image will be cut off from the top and the bottom. If the viewport has a smaller aspect-ratio than the image, part of the image will be cut off from the left and the right side. So, it will always show an incomplete image unless the aspect-ratio of the viewport is exactly the same as the aspect-ratio of the image.</p>

			<h3>Two items</h3>
			<p>There are many situations that two different items have to be displayed in relation to each other on a page, or in a section of a page. In this section, a study is made of how these situations can be layed out.</p>
			<section>
				<h4>Example with text</h4>
				<p>How can two individual, but somehow related text items be layed out. There are many different answers to this question. Here are some of the options.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-1/">
							<h5>One on top of the other</h5>
							<p>This is probably the most simple way to display two items on a page. The one always on top of the other. No CSS is needed to position the elements, this is how things flow <em>naturally</em>. So simple, you might actually forget this is a valid option. </p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-2/">
							<h5>One next to the other</h5>
							<p>On a small screen, the one item is always on top of the other. On bigger screens, when the minimum measure allows it, the items are shown next to each other. Since two text-items will probably have different hights, we can decide things about alignment. In this version the items are vertically aligned relatively to each other's top.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-3/">
							<h5>One next to the other with vertical-align: middle</h5>
							<p>The same as the previous version. But in this version the items are vertically aligned relatively to each other's middle, which sometimes works nicely for items with uncontrolably long or short headings.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-4/">
							<h5>One next to the other with vertical-align: bottom</h5>
							<p>The same as the previous version. But in this version the items are vertically aligned relatively to each other's bottom, which sometimes works nicely.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-5/">
							<h5>One on top of the other, the first one a bit bigger</h5>
							<p>The first item in a list is often more important. There are different ways to emphasize this, one of them is using a larger font-size. On small screens, the first item will just have a larger font-size, on larger screens the first item will also be wider, because the width of the measure is related to the font-size</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-6/">
							<h5>The other on top of the one, the second one a bit bigger</h5>
							<p>The first item in a list is often more important, but sometimes you don't want to show it as the first item. The first item should probably be bigger, but in this case not first. On small screens, the first item will just have a larger font-size, on larger screens the first item will also be wider, because the width of the measure is related to the font-size. <em>Works only in flexbox enabled browsers</em></p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-7/">
							<h5>One on top of the other, the second one a bit bigger, with reversed order for wider viewports</h5>
							<p>Similar to the previous version. In this version, on small screens, the first item is visually displayed as the first item. On bigger screens, it's shown as the second one. <em>Works only in flexbox enabled browsers</em></p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-8/">
							<h5>One on top of the other, the second one a bit bigger, with reversed order dependent on aspect ratio</h5>
							<p>Similar to the previous version. In this version, on small screens and on big screens with viewports with an aspect-ration less than 1/1, the first item (this one) is shown as the first item. On bigger screens with an aspect-ratio bigger than 1/1, it's shown as the second one. <em>Works only in flexbox enabled browsers</em></p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-9/">
							<h5>One on top of the other, the second one a bit bigger, with reversed order dependent on viewport height</h5>
							<p>Similar to the previous version. In this version, on <em>lower</em> screens, the first item is shown as the first item. On <em>higher</em> viewports, it's shown as the second one. <em>Works only in flexbox enabled browsers</em></p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-10/">
							<h5>The second item is more important</h5>
							<p>By simply making the font-size of the second item bigger it gets more attention. Very simple, pretty effective. It might be less effective on smaller screens when the second item is not immediately visible.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-11/">
							<h5>The second item is more important</h5>
							<p>Another variant where the second item is more important. This time, if the screen is wide enough, the two items are shown next to each other.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/02-two-items/text/variant-12/">
							<h5>Bilingual layout</h5>
							<p>Sometimes we publish the same text in two languages next to each other, for instance English and German. If we use Josef Müller-Brockmann's measure theory, where the ideal measure is based on width of words, these two texts will have a different width. An English ideal measure of ten words for the Georgia is about 23.5em wide and the German ideal measure is 29em.</p>

			<h3>Three items</h3>
			<p>There are many situations that two different items have to be displayed in relation to each other on a page, or in a section of a page. In this section, a study is made of how these situations can be layed out.</p>
			<section>
				<h4>Examples with text</h4>
				<p>How can three individual, but somehow related text items be layed out. There are many different answers to this question. Here are some of the options.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/03-three-items/text/variant-1/">
							<h5>Three items, the one above the other</h5>
							<p>The simplest way to display three items is to put one above the other. Works on all kinds of screens.</p>
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/03-three-items/text/variant-2/">
							<h5>Three items, the one above the other on small screens, next to each other when it fits</h5>
							<p>On wider screens we can show items next to each other. The hard part here is finding a logical breakpoint to switch from one to three columns without breaking the layout on <em>any</em> resolution.</p>
						</a>

			<h3>Eleven items</h3>
			<p>The possible layouts with eleven items are endless. There is no way we can investigate them all. But there is something interesting about the number eleven, when it comes to possible layouts. We can make some very nice patterns with this number of items.</p>
			<section>
				<h4>Examples with text</h4>
				<p>How can eleven individual, but somehow related text items be layed out. There are many different answers to this question. Here are some of the options.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="/layout-studies/fixed-amount/11-eleven-items/text/variant-1/">
							<h5>Eleven items in several different layouts, with emphasis on the first (few) items</h5>
							<p>You can make quite a few logical layouts with eleven items, especially if it makes sense to emphasise the first (few) items, like you might want to do on a news site or a blog.</p>
