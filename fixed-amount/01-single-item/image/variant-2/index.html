		<h1>An image of 100% width, with a max-width.</h1>
		<p>This image is fluid in width and height, as long as the viewport is less than 640px wide. If the screen is smaller than 640px, the image will be 100% wide, and the height will automatically adjust, to keep the correct ratio. If the screen is wider there will be white space around it. This is a fairly common pattern, it is one of the more basic responsive image solutions.</p>
