		<h1>An image with a fixed size</h1>
		<p>Just an image without any styling. It will be displayed as 640px wide and 480px high. If a screen is smaller, parts of it will be cut off. If the screen is wider there will be white space around it. There might be some use-cases for this pattern. I don't know many. Showing the size of the image in relation to the size of the viewport is one of them.</p>
