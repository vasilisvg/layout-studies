		<h1>A fullscreen image that doesn't deform. Aligned at 75%.</h1>
		<p>This image is always fullscreen. When the viewport has a bigger aspect-ratio than the image, a larger part of the image will be cut off from the top, and a smaller part from the bottom. If the viewport has a smaller aspect-ratio than the image, a larger part of the image will be cut off from the left, and a smaller part from the right. So, it will always show an incomplete image unless the aspect-ratio of the viewport is exactly the same as the aspect-ratio of the image. There are an endless amount of alignment variations possible, since we can use any percentage we want for horizontal and vertical alignment. Different percentages have different effects. Which one should be used depends on what you want, and on the conposition of the image. Inspired by how the Rijksmuseum <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/AK-MAK-995">shows its collection</a>. <em>(Doesn't work on browsers that don't support the <code>vw</code> and <code>vh</code> unit or the <code>aspect-ratio</code> mediaquery)</em></p>
