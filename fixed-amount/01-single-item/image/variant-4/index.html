		<h1>An image of 100% width and 100% height, <em>without</em> a max-width or max-height.</h1>
		<p>This image is fluid in width and height. It is always as wide and high as the viewport, which means that the image will probably not be displayed in the correct ratio. If the screen gets wider than the width of the image (640px), or higher than the height (480px) the image may look blurry. It will probably look weird to most people. <em>(Doesn't work on browsers that don't support the <code>vw</code> and <code>vh</code> unit)</em></p>
