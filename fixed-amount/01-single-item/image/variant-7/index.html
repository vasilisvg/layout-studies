		<h1>A fullscreen right and bottom aligned image that doesn't deform.</h1>
		<p>This image is always fullscreen. When the viewport has a bigger aspect-ratio than the image, part of the image will be cut off from the top. If the viewport has a smaller aspect-ratio than the image, part of the image will be cut off from the left. So, it will always show an incomplete image unless the aspect-ratio of the viewport is exactly the same as the aspect-ratio of the image. There are an endless amount of alignment variations possible, since we can use any percentage we want for horizontal and vertical alignment. Inspired by how the Rijksmuseum <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/AK-MAK-995">shows its collection</a>. <em>(Doesn't work on browsers that don't support the <code>vw</code> and <code>vh</code> unit or the <code>aspect-ratio</code> mediaquery)</em></p>
