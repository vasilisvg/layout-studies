		<h1>Flexible, single or multi-column layout with max-width</h1>
		<p>This is a simple, readable version of a layout. It's a heading, with a few paragraphs of text with minimal styling. The layout is fluid for smaller screens, but it has a maximum width. This works on all devices, on most browsers. The text is always easy to read.</p>
		<h2>It has a grid</h2>
		<p>On bigger screens, it uses a simple three column grid to make the first heading and the first paragraph stand out. This kind of layout is especially useful for longer articles. Other elements can span across all columns as well, if needed. It's a rather classic layout, sometimes seen in books and magazines.</p>
		<h2>It has more than one grid</h2>
		<p>If the text gets even wider, a fourth column is added to the right. This extra column can be used for various porposes. In this example a marginal note is added. <span class="marginal-note">Marginal notes can be shown in the margin if the screen is big enough.</span> This marginal note is displayed inline on smaller screens.</p>
