		<h1>Single, flexible small column with two fixed widths</h1>
		<p>This is a rather simple single column layout. It starts out with a width of 90% on smaller screens, with a max width of 27em. It then stops for a while and collects a lot of white-space to the left and right. Once there is room enough, the width of the measure is set to 41.375em, and the font size is increased.</p>
		<p>There are many variations possible. Some in between sizes could exist, and something for wider screens could be made up. But would that make it better? What I like about this particular combination of layouts is that it's so simple. Yet it works. It <em>always</em> looks good. It's based on the homepage of <a href="http://ia.net/">Information Architects</a>.</p>
