# Single, flexible small column with two fixed widths

This is a rather simple single column layout. It starts out with a width of 90% on smaller screens, with a max width of 27em. It then stops for a while and collects a lot of white-space to the left and right. Once there is room enough, the width of the measure is set to 41.375em, and the font size is increased.
