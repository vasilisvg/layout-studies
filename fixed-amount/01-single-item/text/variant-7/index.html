		<h1>Flexible, single or multi-column layout with some max-widths and some parts stretching over multiple columns</h1>
		<p>This is a set of layouts that gets more complex as the viewport grows. At first everything is layed out over one single column, but as soon as the measure allowes for an extra column, it is added to the left.</p>
		<h2>It has a grid</h2>
		<p>At first, a three column grid is applied. The header and the introductory paragraph span over these three columns, while the body text stays within the ideal measure. The font-size of the first paragraph can be increased to keep readability optimal.</p>
		<p>When there's room for a fourth column, it is added to the left again. This time only the header spans all four columns, the first paragraph remains as before. This pattern is copied from <a href="http://wasstra.at/030/">De Wasstraat</a>, where the video is considered to be the main content, and uses as much space as possible.</p>
