# Flexible, single or multi-column layout with some max-widths and some parts spanning multiple columns

This is a set of layouts that gets more complex as the viewport grows. At first everything is layed out over one single column, but as soon as the measure allows for an extra column, it is added to the left. This can be repeated.
