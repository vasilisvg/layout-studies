		<h1>Flexible, single or multi-column layout with max-width</h1>
		<p>This is a simple, readable version of a layout. It's a heading, with a single paragraph of text with minimal styling. The layout is fluid for smaller screens, but it has a maximum width. This works on all devices, on most browsers. The text is always easy to read.</p>
		<h2>It has a grid</h2>
		<p>On bigger screens, it uses a simple three column grid to make the first heading and the first paragraph stand out. This kind of layout is especially useful for longer articles. Other elements can span across all three columns as well, if needed. It's a rather classic layout, sometimes seen in books and magazines.</p>
