# Flexible, single or multi-column layout with max-width

On bigger screens, it uses a simple three column grid to make the first heading and the first paragraph stand out. This kind of layout is especially useful for longer articles. Other elements can span across all three columns as well, if needed. It's a rather classic layout, sometimes seen in books and magazines.
