# Single, flexible column with changing percentages, with a rather large max width

This is a simple looking one column layout. The margins to the left and right change a few times, at different viewport sizes. The width of the measure grows from 91% to 60% with a max-width of 44.5em. But there's more. An interesting thing about this layout is that the first paragraph is 7% wider that the body copy, and the heading is even wider: 15%
