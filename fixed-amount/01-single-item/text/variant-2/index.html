		<h1>Single, flexible, column with max-width</h1>
		<p>This is the most simple, readable version of a layout. It's a heading, with a single paragraph of text with minimal styling. The layout is fluid for smaller screens, but it has a maximum width. This works on all devices, on most browsers. The text is always easy to read.</p>
