		<h1>The other on top of the one, the <em>second</em> one a bit bigger dependent on aspect ratio</h1>
		<p>The first item in a list is often more important, but sometimes you don't want to show it as the first item. In this version, on small screens and on big screens with viewports with an aspect-ration less than 1/1, the first item (this one) is shown as the first item. On bigger screens with an aspect-ratio bigger than 1/1, it's shown as the second one. <em>Works only in flexbox enabled browsers</em></p>

		<h1>Single, flexible column</h1>
		<p>This is the most simple, readable version of a layout. It's a heading, with a single paragraph of text with minimal styling. The layout is fluid for smaller screens, but it has a maximum width. This works on all devices, on most browsers. The text is always easy to read. </p>
