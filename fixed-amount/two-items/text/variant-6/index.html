		<h1>The other on top of the one, the <em>second</em> one a bit bigger</h1>
		<p>The first item in a list is often more important, but sometimes you don't want to show it as the first item. The first item should probably be bigger, but in this case not first. On small screens, the first item will just have a larger font-size, on larger screens the first item will also be wider, because the width of the measure is related to the font-size. <em>Works only in flexbox enabled browsers</em></p>

		<h1>Single, flexible column</h1>
		<p>This is the most simple, readable version of a layout. It's a heading, with a single paragraph of text with minimal styling. The layout is fluid for smaller screens, but it has a maximum width. This works on all devices, on most browsers. The text is always easy to read. </p>
