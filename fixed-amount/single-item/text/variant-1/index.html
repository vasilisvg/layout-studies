		<h1>Single, flexible column</h1>
		<p>This is probably the most simple version of a layout. It's a heading, with a single paragraph of text with minimal styling. The layout is fluid, it is as wide as the viewport. This works on all devices, on all browsers. On bigger screens the text will probably become hard to read.</p>
