		<h1>Single, flexible column with changing percentages, with a rather large max width</h1>
		<p>This is a simple looking one column layout. The margins to the left and right change a few times, at different viewport sizes. The width of the measure grows from 91% to 60% with a max-width of 44.5em. But there's more.</p>
		<p>An interesting thing about this layout is that the first paragraph is 7% wider that the body copy, and the heading is even wider: 15%. This creates a nice, flexible shape on the right side of the text. This layout is copied from <a href="http://www.holtzbrinck.com/">this project</a> by <a href="http://ia.net/">IA</a>. There are endless variations possible with these kinds of layouts. Absolutely worth experimenting with.</p>
		<p>Looks wonderful while resizing.</p>
