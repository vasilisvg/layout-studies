		<h1>An idea for a blog page</h1>
		<p>Many blogs have a few introductions for a few articles on their homepage. Sometimes 5, sometimes 10, whatever. I think the default for Wordpress is 10. Eleven items on the homepage gives us a nice amount to create some interesting layouts, where the first, or first few items get a bit more emphasis.</p>

		<h1>Eleven is a nice even number for a responsive layout</h1>
		<p>You wouldn't think so, but eleven is actually a pretty nice number for a responsive layout. You can create quite a few layouts with it: 10✕1 + 1 = 11, 5✕2 + 1 = 11, 3✕3 + 2 = 11 and 2✕4 +3 =11. If you don't understand what I'm talking about, just resize this screen, or take a look at <a href="http://nerd.vasilis.nl/wp-content/uploads/nerd-home-1.png">this image</a>.</p>

		<h1>Maybe it's more nerdy than usable</h1>
		<p>Maybe this is not the most useful layout ever. But it is a nice idea. It fills the white-space, which might not be as good an idea as it sounds. White-space is actually quite important to create an overview of what's happening. You shouldn't always fill everything just because you can. It also turns out to be pretty hard to make every version of the layout look stunning on every viewport size. There's definitely more needed than just classic measure-theory here to make this work.</p>

		<h1>One of the harder things is, how to vertically-align this stuff?</h1>
		<p><em>Every text on the web</em> has a different length, and thus at least sometimes, a different height than its neighbor. You can not have complete control over the height of an item. So especially on a blog, where titles and introductions can vary considerably in length, thinking about vertical aligment is very important. It is pretty hard too, because not all classical alignment ideas work on the web. You can't align all items at the text bottom of the titles, for instance, which might definitely be something we'd like in a chaotic situation like this. </p>

		<h1>How does this fit within classic measure theory?</h1>
		<p>There are two basic theories about how long the ideal measure, the ideal length of one line of text should be. One says between 45 and 75 characters. And the other says it should be something like 10 words. The 10 words idea is a bit too strict for what we need here, our layout is highly flexible. So it makes sense to use the other idea. You see the problem if you have a feeling for maths: 45✕45 > 75.</p>

		<h1>Tho times the minimal measure, is more than one maximum measure</h1>
		<p>So two columns of 45 characters are 15 characters wider than one column of 75 characters. If we want to fix this we have to <em>increase the font-size</em> of the single column by 120%. This, actually, looks pretty good, and it is what we want: more emphasis on the first (few) articles. If we increase the viewport from smaller to ever bigger screens, the layout will jump from one version to the other. Not very fluid between jumps, especially at the first one, but the proportions look ok. </p>

		<h1>An idea for a blog page</h1>
		<p>This is actually the same content as the first item on this page. Repeating because I need 11 items filled. Many blogs have a few introductions for a few articles on their homepage. Sometimes 5, sometimes 10, whatever. I think the default for Wordpress is 10. Eleven items on the homepage gives us a nice amount to create some interesting layouts, where the first, or first few items get a bit more emphasis.</p>
