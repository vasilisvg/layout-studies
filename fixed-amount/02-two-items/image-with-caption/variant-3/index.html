		<h1>An image with a caption with a max-width</h1>
		<p>The image grows to a maximum of 640px, which is the exact width of the image in use. The caption grows with it untill the measure gets too wide. In this case the caption doesn't get wider than 24em. This will result in a measure that's smaller than the image, on most browser-configurations.</p>
