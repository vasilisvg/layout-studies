		<h1>One next to the other</h1>
		<p>This is another simple way to display two items on a page. On a small screen, the one item is always on top of the other. On bigger screens, when the minimum measure allows it, the items are shown next to each other. Since two text-items will probably have different hights, we can decide things about alignment. In this version the items are vertically aligned relatively to each other's top.</p>

		<h1>Single, flexible column</h1>
		<p>This is the most simple, readable version of a layout. It's a heading, with a single paragraph of text with minimal styling. The layout is fluid for smaller screens, but it has a maximum width. This works on all devices, on most browsers. The text is always easy to read.</p>
