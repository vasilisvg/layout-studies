		<h1>One on top of the other, the first one a bit bigger</h1>
		<p>The first item in a list is often more important. There are different ways to emphasize this, one of them is using a larger font-size. On small screens, the first item will just have a larger font-size, on larger screens the first item will also be wider, because the width of the measure is related to the font-size</p>

		<h1>Single, flexible column</h1>
		<p>This is the most simple, readable version of a layout. It's a heading, with a single paragraph of text with minimal styling. The layout is fluid for smaller screens, but it has a maximum width. This works on all devices, on most browsers. The text is always easy to read.</p>
