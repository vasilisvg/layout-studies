		<h1>Three items of some importance</h1>
		<p>Sometimes we want more than one item on a page. For instance, on a blog we might want the articles prominently in the middle, we might want the reactions to the left (if it's a nice community), and we might want to show some <em>widgets</em> to the right. This works on a large screen. On a smaller screen we can show the comments section and the widgets below the main content. We probably have to make them accessible in another way: If we depend on scrolling only most people on a small screen will probably miss it. But in this example we won't do that.</p>

		<h1>Widget</h1>
		<p>This widget is here to make the marketing department happy. It doesn't really matter that nobody ever uses it.</p>
		<h1>Widget 2</h1>
		<p>The marketing department laughed out loud when they heard the term <em>functional white-space</em>. <q>Not as functional as a widget!</q></p>
