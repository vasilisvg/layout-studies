		<h1>One on top of the other</h1>
		<p>This is probably the most simple way to display three items on a page. The three items stacked on top of each other. No CSS is needed to position the elements, this is how block elements are displayed <em>naturally</em> with CSS. So simple, you might actually forget this is a valid option. </p>

		<h1>Single, flexible column</h1>
		<p>This is the most simple, readable version of a layout. It's a heading, with a single paragraph of text with minimal styling. The layout is fluid for smaller screens, but it has a maximum width. This works on all devices, on most browsers. The text is always easy to read.</p>

		<h1>A third, related item</h1>
		<p>On a website, or in every publication really, all items have different content. So, in order to make sure that these layout tests somehow look <em>real</em>, this paragraph has its unique content.</p>
